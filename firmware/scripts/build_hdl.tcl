    # BOOT.bin ~1.7 MB larger (4.57 MB vs 2.85 MB) than a fresh build produces.

    # from disk, so an in-memory design property never reaches write_bitstream.
    # That was measured - the bitstream came out uncompressed with no warning.

    # the design open, which is the one place the property reliably applies.
